# Book Character Relationship Database Project
This project contains SQL scripts to create and manage a database of books, their characters, and the relationships between these characters.

The database includes three tables:
- *book*: Stores book details like name, series, and author.
- *character*: Contains character information linked to specific books, including their gender.
- *relationship*: Defines different types of relationships between characters such as lovers, friends, siblings, and more.

The SQL code includes commands to create these tables, insert sample data, and perform queries to explore the character connections within various book series.

This project is useful for literary analysis and understanding character dynamics across multiple series.
